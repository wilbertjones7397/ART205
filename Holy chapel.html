<h3>
<span>Teachings Of The Week</span>
</h3><br>
    <p>
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  <br>
The earth was without form, and void;<br>
 and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.<br>
Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.

And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
 God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.
Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. 
And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.
Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so.
And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
 God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.
Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. 
And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.
Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so, AMEN.
